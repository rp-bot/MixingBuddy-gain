    problem_description: |
      The balance issue in Version A is with the '{stem_name}'. 
      It is '{problem_description}'. To achieve the correct balance 
      heard in Version B, the gain on the '{stem_name}' stem should be 
      '{solution}'.

    detailed_analysis: |
      Version A has a mixing problem where the '{stem_name}' stem is 
      '{problem_description}'. This creates an unbalanced mix. 
      Version B demonstrates the correct balance with the '{stem_name}' 
      stem properly leveled. The solution is to {solution} the 
      '{stem_name}' stem to match the professional balance in Version B.

  instruction_template: |
    Analyze the mixing balance issue in Version A and explain how to 
    achieve the correct balance shown in Version B.
