  - "You are listening to a {duration_sec}s segment of a track. The available stems are: {stems_present}. The anchor stem is {anchor_stem}. Please analyze the mix and provide mixing advice."
  - "This is a {duration_sec}s audio segment with stems: {stems_present}. The {anchor_stem} is the reference. Evaluate the mix balance and suggest improvements."
  - "Analyze this {duration_sec}s track segment. Stems present: {stems_present}. Use {anchor_stem} as your reference. What mixing adjustments are needed?"
  - "Listen to this {duration_sec}s audio clip. Available tracks: {stems_present}. The {anchor_stem} serves as the anchor. How should the mix be adjusted?"

response_templates:

    - "The mix sounds balanced. All elements are at appropriate levels."

  quiet:

    - "The {target_stem} is way too low. Add {intended_gain_db} dB to make it present."
    - "The {target_stem} needs a significant boost. Raise it by {intended_gain_db} dB."

  loud:
    - "The {target_stem} is too loud. Reduce the {target_stem} level by {abs_gain_db} dB to balance the mix."
    - "The {target_stem} is overpowering. Turn it down by {abs_gain_db} dB."
    - "The {target_stem} is too prominent. Cut it by {abs_gain_db} dB to balance."
