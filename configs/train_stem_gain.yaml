# Main training config for stem classification and gain regression model

defaults:
  - data: stem_gain_data
  - model: stem_gain_model
  - training: stem_gain_training
  - experiment_tracking: wandb
  - experiment_naming: experiment_naming
  - _self_

# Environment settings
env:
  seed: 42
  project_name: "stem-gain-model"
  output_dir: "outputs/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${now:%H-%M-%S}"

# Experiment tracking settings
experiment_tracking:
  use_wandb: false
  use_mlflow: false

# Resume training configuration
# This overrides the resume settings in the training config
# Set enabled: true and provide checkpoint_path to resume from a checkpoint
# weight_only: true loads only model weights (not optimizer/scheduler state)
# weight_only: false resumes full training state (requires compatible architecture)
# resume:
#   enabled: true
#   weight_only: true  # Recommended: load weights only, start fresh training state
#   checkpoint_path: "outputs/checkpoints/mixing_buddy_milestone_0/full-stem_gain-none-musdb/checkpoint-12500"  # Path relative to project root, e.g., "outputs/checkpoints/mixing_buddy_milestone_0/full-stem_gain-none-musdb/checkpoint-2500"
