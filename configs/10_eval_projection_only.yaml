# Evaluation config for projection-only training (experiment 10)
# This evaluates the model with NO LoRA adapters - only trained audio projection
defaults:
  - data: 04_instructions_no_anchor
  - model: qwen2_7b_mert
  - evaluation: evaluation
  - training: training # Include training config for trainer compatibility
  - experiment_tracking: wandb
  - experiment_naming: experiment_naming
  - plotting: plotting
  - _self_

# Environment settings
env:
  seed: 42
  project_name: "automatic-mixing-milestone-0"
  # Output directory will be determined by checkpoint run name

# Model checkpoint settings
# Set this to the path of your trained MERT projection-only model checkpoint
# Options:
# - null: Use base model (no trained weights)
# - "latest": Automatically use the latest checkpoint
# - "path/to/checkpoint": Use specific checkpoint
checkpoint_path: null # Update this to the trained MERT checkpoint path

# IMPORTANT: The evaluation output directory will be automatically determined
# from the checkpoint path. For example, if checkpoint is:
# "outputs/checkpoints/mixing_buddy_milestone_0/qlora-qwen2-7b-mert-r16a32-musdb-XXXX-XXXX/checkpoint-XXX"
# Then evaluation will be saved to:
# "outputs/evaluation/qlora-qwen2-7b-mert-r16a32-musdb-XXXX-XXXX/predictions/"

# Predictions file path for metrics computation
# If not specified, the script will use the new evaluation structure
# predictions_path: "outputs/evaluation/qlora-qwen2-7b-mert-r16a32-musdb-XXXX-XXXX/predictions/predictions.jsonl"

# Plotting configuration
plotting:
  # These will be automatically set based on checkpoint path
  metrics_file: null # Will be set to {output_dir}/predictions/metrics_results_detailed.json
  output_dir: null # Will be set to {output_dir}/predictions/

# Experiment tracking settings
experiment_tracking:
  use_wandb: true
  use_mlflow: false

# Evaluation-specific overrides for projection-only model
evaluation:
  # Since this is projection-only, we want to test if the audio projection actually helps
  use_random_projection: false # Use the trained projection weights
  # We might want to compare with random projection as an ablation
  # use_random_projection: true  # Uncomment to test with random weights

  # Increased generation samples to better evaluate projection-only performance
  num_generation_samples: 50 # More samples for better statistical significance

  # Memory settings - projection-only should use less memory
  memory:
    max_memory_usage_gb: 6.0 # Lower than full LoRA models
