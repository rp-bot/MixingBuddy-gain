# @package model

# Model configuration - NO LoRA adapters, train audio projection + top 3 MERT encoder layers
# MERT provides 25 layers * 1024 features -> learnable weighted average -> 1024 dimensional output
# Top 3 encoder layers (22, 23, 24) are unfrozen to learn high-level semantic features
# This should help the model distinguish "no_error" cases from "needs adjustment" cases

# Audio projection configuration
# MERT uses learnable weighted average of 25 layers -> 1024 dimensional output
