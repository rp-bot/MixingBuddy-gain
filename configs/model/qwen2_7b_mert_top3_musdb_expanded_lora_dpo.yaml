# Model configuration for DPO - WITH LoRA adapters
# Same architecture as SFT, but config_name includes "-dpo" for separate checkpoint directory
# MERT provides 25 layers * 1024 features -> learnable weighted average -> 1024 dimensional output
# Top 3 encoder layers (22, 23, 24) are unfrozen to learn high-level semantic features
# LoRA adapters are enabled on LLM to allow fine-tuning while keeping base model frozen

# Audio projection configuration
# MERT uses learnable weighted average of 25 layers -> 1024 dimensional output
# Need to project to LLM hidden size (typically 3584 for Qwen2-7B)
# With smaller input (1024), we can use a deeper, more expressive projection

  # Deep projection: 1024 -> 2048 -> 4096 -> 2048 -> llm_hidden_size
  # More capacity since we saved memory with weighted averaging
