\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
To address this gap, we propose a multimodal audio-language model that takes a flawed mix as input and generates structured textual feedback identifying mixing flaws and suggesting corrective gain adjustments.
Our approach focuses on relative gain relationships among multitrack stems.
This focus allows us to investigate whether the model can learn the relative nature of gain relationships.
While also providing a tractable starting point before extending to more complex mixing parameters such as equalization or dynamic processing.
the methodology section is organized as follows \ref{sec:dataset} Dataset, \ref{sec:architecture} Architecture, \ref{sec:training-strategy} Training Strategy.
