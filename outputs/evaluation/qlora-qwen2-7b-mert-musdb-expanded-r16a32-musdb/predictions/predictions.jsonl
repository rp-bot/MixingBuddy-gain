The process involves balancing the relative levels of each element to ensure they are in harmony with each other, without one overpowering the others.\n\n1. **Vocals:** Listen closely to the vocal track. Pay attention to the clarity, presence, and overall volume. If the vocals are too quiet, increase their level; if they're too loud or overpowering, reduce their volume. Ensure that the vocals are clear and audible without being harsh or muffled.\n\n2. **Drums:** Analyze the drum track for its volume and clarity. The drums should provide a strong rhythmic foundation while not overwhelming the other elements. If the drums are too loud, reduce their level so they don't drown out the vocals or bass. If they're too soft, increase their volume slightly.\n\n3. **Bass:** Evaluate the bass track's volume and presence. Bass should support the rhythm and provide depth to the mix. Adjust its level to ensure it complements the vocals and drums without being too dominant or too weak. Bass should be felt but not overly aggressive.\n\n4. **Overall Mix:** After adjusting individual stems, listen to the mix as a whole. Ensure that all elements are balanced and contribute positively to the overall listening experience. The mix should feel cohesive, with no one element overpowering the others.\n\n5. **Feedback and Adjustment:** Seek feedback from listeners and make necessary adjustments based on their comments. It's crucial to strike a balance between clarity, dynamics, and overall balance. Avoid making drastic changes; small, incremental adjustments are often more effective in achieving a balanced mix.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a mix where each element contributes to the music's emotional impact without causing any unwanted distortion or masking important aspects of the performance.

To provide an accurate analysis, we need to listen carefully to identify any issues in the mix balance between these elements. However, without actual audio files or specific details about the track, it's challenging to offer a detailed analysis. Generally, in a balanced mix:\n\n1. **Vocals:** Vocals should be the primary focus in most cases as they are the main driving force behind the song. The vocals should be clear, well-defined, and prominent enough to carry the melody and emotion of the song. If the vocals sound muddy or buried under other instruments, adjustments might be needed.\n\n2. **Drums:** Drums provide the rhythmic foundation of the music. They should have a solid presence but not overpower other elements in the mix. The kick drum should be strong and punchy, while the snare, cymbals, and hi-hats should complement the kick drum without being too loud or dominant.\n\n3. **Bass:** Bass lines should support the rhythm and help define the groove of the song. They should sit comfortably in the mix without overpowering the other elements. Bass should be tight and not muddy, providing a solid foundation for the song.\n\nTo evaluate the mix balance, one would typically listen to each element separately and then together to determine if there is any imbalance. If the drums are overpowering the vocals, for example, the mix needs adjustment. Similarly, if the bass is too loud and covering up the drums or vocals, it also requires adjustment. \n\nIn general, the mix should allow the listener to hear all three elements clearly and without one overpowering the others. If there is a lack of clarity or balance, the engineer should adjust levels, EQ, compression, and other processing parameters to achieve a balanced mix where each component contributes effectively to the overall sound.\n\nFor specific advice on the audio segments, I would need more information such as the type of music, the specific parts of the stems that need improvement, and the desired outcome in terms of the mix balance. With this information, I could provide a more detailed analysis and recommendations for adjustments.", "target_stem": "bass", "error_category": "very_loud", "intended_gain_db": 8.260977972185067, "start_sec": 90.0, "end_sec": 100.0, "expected_magnitude_min_db": 6.0, "expected_magnitude_max_db": 12.0}

The vocals should remain around this level to maintain a balanced mix.\n\n2. **Drums**: The drums are the primary focus in this mix. They are at an appropriate level, providing a solid foundation for the mix. The drums should stay within this range to ensure they are neither too loud nor too soft.\n\n3. **Bass**: The bass is present and contributes to the overall feel of the track. It is not overwhelming but can be slightly increased in volume to enhance the low-end punch and depth without going overboard. The bass should be boosted by 2-3 dB to achieve a better balance with the drums.\n\n4. **Other**: This includes all other elements such as guitars, keyboards, and any additional sound effects. These should be at a lower level than the drums and bass but still audible. The other stems should be adjusted so that they sit comfortably between the drums and bass levels, adding depth and interest without overpowering the mix.\n\nIn summary:\n- Vocals: Maintain current level\n- Drums: Maintain current level\n- Bass: Increase by 2-3 dB\n- Other: Decrease by 2-3 dB\n\nThe aim is to achieve a balanced mix where the drums serve as the foundation, the bass adds depth and warmth, and the other elements complement these without taking over the mix.", "target_stem": "bass", "error_category": "quiet", "intended_gain_db": -3.3856216985105516, "start_sec": 0.0, "end_sec": 10.0, "expected_magnitude_min_db": 3.0, "expected_magnitude_max_db": 6.0}
