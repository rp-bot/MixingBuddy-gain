You might need to reduce the bass level by 2-6 dB.\n   - If the vocals are too quiet, the mix may lack focus. Boosting the vocals by 2-4 dB could improve clarity.\n   - If the drums are not punchy enough, consider boosting the kick and snare slightly, possibly by 1-3 dB.\n   - For \"other\" elements, ensure they are not too loud or too soft relative to the main components.

Drums should be present but not so loud that they dominate the mix. They should complement the vocals and other instruments.\n\n4. **Bass**: Assess whether the bass adds depth and warmth to the mix. The bass should be noticeable enough to give the track its groove without being too intrusive.\n\n5. **Other Instruments/Sounds**: Notice any other instruments or sounds that might be present. They should contribute positively to the mix without causing imbalance.\n\n6. **Volume Levels**: Ensure that all stems are at appropriate levels. Each element should be audible but not so loud that it causes distortion or masks other parts of the mix.\n\n7. **Mixing Techniques**: Consider if the mixing techniques used enhance the mix. This includes panning, EQ, compression, reverb, and other effects applied to each stem.\n\nIf you follow these steps and identify that one or more stems is out of balance, adjust the volume levels accordingly. Typically, you might:\n- Increase a quiet stem,\n- Decrease a loud stem,\n- Adjust panning if needed,\n- Modify EQ to ensure clarity and separation,\n- Use compression or limiting sparingly to avoid distortion.\n\nRemember, the goal is to achieve a balanced mix where all elements work together harmoniously, supporting the song's overall feel and message.", "target_stem": "drums", "error_category": "no_error", "intended_gain_db": 0.0, "start_sec": 50.0, "end_sec": 60.0, "expected_magnitude_min_db": null, "expected_magnitude_max_db": null}
