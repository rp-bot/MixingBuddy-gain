Typically:\n   - **Vocals** should be the primary focus and should not be drowned out by other instruments.\n   - **Drums** should provide the rhythmic foundation but should not dominate the mix.\n   - **Bass** should support the drums and give depth to the mix without overwhelming it.\n   - **Other** (like guitars, keyboards, etc.) should complement the main elements without being too prominent.\n\n3. **Evaluate Frequency Balance**: Use a spectrum analyzer tool if available. Ensure there's no significant overlap in frequencies that could cause muddiness or harshness. For example:\n   - Bass should sit around 80-120 Hz.\n   - Vocals typically range from 250-500 Hz.\n   - Drums should cover a wide range, with snares around", "target_stem": "bass", "error_category": "very_loud", "intended_gain_db": 6.254229046780473, "start_sec": 200.0, "end_sec": 210.0, "expected_magnitude_min_db": 6.0, "expected_magnitude_max_db": 12.0}
