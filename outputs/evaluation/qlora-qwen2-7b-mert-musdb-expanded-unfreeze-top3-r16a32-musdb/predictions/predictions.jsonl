To balance the mix, you might want to increase the volume level of this stem slightly (e.g., +3 dB) without going over the volume levels of the other stems.\n\nBy adjusting the volume levels according to these suggestions, you should be able to achieve a better balance between the different stems in the mix.", "target_stem": "vocals", "error_category": "very_quiet", "intended_gain_db": -9.415336278380083, "start_sec": 160.0, "end_sec": 170.0, "expected_magnitude_min_db": 6.0, "expected_magnitude_max_db": 12.0}
