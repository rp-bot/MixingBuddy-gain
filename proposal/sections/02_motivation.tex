\section*{Motivation}

\subsection*{Research Gap}
Current automatic mixing systems operate as ``black boxes,'' generating final outputs without providing explainable, actionable guidance that audio engineers need. 
No existing systems provide mixing advice based on multi-track analysis and relative gain relationships, leaving a gap in the ability to learn and reason about the nuanced, context-dependent gain relationships that are fundamental to professional mixing.

\subsection*{Research Impact}
This research aims to bridge this gap by teaching the model to reason about mix balance relative to a stable reference point (anchor track), aligning its understanding with the cognitive workflows of human engineers. 
This approach enables human-AI collaboration by providing musicians and producers with contextually relevant, actionable advice that can integrate into their existing creative workflow, supporting a more interactive and transparent mixing process.
