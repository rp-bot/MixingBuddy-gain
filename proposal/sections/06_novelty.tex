\section{Novelty of Proposed Work}

This research proposes a framework for generating gain-balancing advice by conditioning an Audio-Language Model (ALM) on an anchor track, offering an alternative to current "black-box" or single-mix analysis approaches.
The approach models the human workflow of mixing relative to an anchor element, shifting from absolute audio analysis to relational reasoning that aligns with how audio engineers work.
The method explores architectural approaches for representing anchor-target relationships within multi-modal ALMs, develops a methodology for creating structured, instruction-following datasets based on anchor-target pairs, and implements an evaluation protocol that assesses the practical usefulness of generated advice through professional audio engineer studies.
This work contributes to the field by proposing a paradigm for human-AI collaboration in music mixing and exploring the alignment between ALM capabilities and the needs of audio professionals.
