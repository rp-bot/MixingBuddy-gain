\section*{Timeline}

\subsection*{Current Progress (Completed)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dataset Setup}: MUSDB18 preprocessing and JSONL format conversion completed
    \item \textbf{Codebase and Pipeline Setup}: Initial implementation and data loading pipeline completed
    \item \textbf{Partial Experiments}: Some fine-tuning experiments and architecture testing completed
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Remaining Tasks (Leading to November 28th Submission)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CITI Certification}: Complete CITI training for IRB approval
    \item \textbf{Experiment Definition and Execution}: Finalize all experimental designs and complete remaining fine-tuning experiments
    \item \textbf{IRB Approval}: Submit and obtain approval for human evaluation studies
    \item \textbf{Human Evaluation}: Conduct evaluation study with audio professionals (anticipated longest phase due to human involvement)
    \item \textbf{Final Deliverables}: Complete paper writing, develop web interface, and deploy to Hugging Face
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Future Expansion (Post-Milestone 0)}
This milestone serves as a foundation for potential expansion in three directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Differentiable Tools}: Integration of differentiable audio processing tools for end-to-end training
    \item \textbf{Extended Audio Effects}: Expansion to include additional mixing parameters (EQ, compression, spatial effects) using the same anchor-conditioned architecture
    \item \textbf{Dataset Quality Assessment \& Curating}: Study whether current multi-track datasets meet professional mixing standards and curate a new dataset with expert consensus to ensure realistic and informed training data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Risk Mitigation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Human Evaluation Delays}: Begin IRB process early and maintain flexible recruitment strategies
    \item \textbf{Timeline Buffer}: Web interface and Hugging Face deployment can be simplified or delayed. Conference paper submission can be later than november 28th. Core research paper (7100 submission) and poster presentation are fixed requirements. Open source documentation can be prioritized based on available time.
\end{itemize}
