\section{Research Statement / Problem}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
The field of automatic mixing in music production faces significant challenges in creating systems that can intelligently balance and enhance multi-track recordings without human intervention. Current approaches often rely on rule-based systems or simple machine learning models that fail to capture the complex, context-dependent decisions made by professional audio engineers.

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can machine learning models be designed to understand the complex relationships between different audio tracks in a mix?
    \item What features and representations are most effective for automatic mixing systems?
    \item How can we evaluate the quality of automatic mixing systems in a way that correlates with human perception?
    \item What are the limitations of current automatic mixing approaches, and how can they be addressed?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope and Objectives}
This research aims to develop novel approaches to automatic mixing that can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatically balance levels, EQ, and dynamics across multiple audio tracks
    \item Adapt to different musical genres and production styles
    \item Provide interpretable results that can be fine-tuned by human engineers
    \item Achieve quality comparable to professional human mixing
\end{itemize}
