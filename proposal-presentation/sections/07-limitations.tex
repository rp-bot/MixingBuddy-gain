\section{Limitations}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{\secname}
\begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> \textbf{Focus on Gain Only}: The model's scope is limited to gain-balancing advice; it does not address other effects like EQ, compression, or spatial effects.
    \item<2-> \textbf{Advisory, Not Prescriptive}: Evaluation focuses on the usefulness of the textual advice, not the numeric accuracy of specific gain predictions.
    \item<3-> \textbf{Dataset Dependency}: The project relies on the MUSDB18 dataset for valid ``ground truth'' for professional mixes.
\end{itemize}
